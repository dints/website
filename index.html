                    <p>I've been designing professionally for several years - with my dynamic roles giving opportunities to develop a skills list outside of the regular “graphic designer” title.</p>
                    <p>Although I have a BA in Games Design, I continually strive to learn as much as I can and grow as not only a designer but as a creative.</p>

                    <p>Over the past years, I have worked on many different types of projects - from designing the website for a highly successful school in Cornwall, to designing the old fashioned stuff with their prospectus and a variety of print advertisements, banners, and promotional media. My goal is to keep my design work fresh, taking influence from upcoming and established trends whilst stamping my own style.</p>
